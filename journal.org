#+TITLE: Semantest Node.js Server - Development Journal
#+AUTHOR: Semantest Team
#+DATE: [2024-01-07]

* Overview

This repository contains the Node.js server component for Semantest browser automation. It acts as a secure gateway and message router between clients and browser extensions, implementing enterprise-grade features for production deployments.

* Repository History

** Monorepo Separation (2024-01-07)

This repository was extracted from the original chatgpt-buddy monorepo as part of Phase 8A of the Semantest platform evolution. The separation preserves the complete git history of the web-buddy-nodejs-server directory.

*** Key Changes
- Extracted from =web-buddy-nodejs-server/= directory in the monorepo
- Now published as =@semantest/nodejs-server= on npm
- Repository URL: https://github.com/semantest/nodejs.server
- Part of the semantest organization
- Depends on TypeScript-EDA framework

*** Post-Separation Setup Required
1. Update package.json dependencies from workspace references to npm packages
2. Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow
3. Configure npm publishing with NPM_TOKEN secret
4. Update README with proper documentation

** Package Configuration Updates (2025-01-07)

As part of the post-monorepo-separation tasks, the package.json was updated to reflect the new organizational structure:

*** Changes Made
- Updated package name to =@semantest/nodejs-server= (using the semantest npm organization)
- Updated repository URLs to point to =https://github.com/semantest/nodejs.server=
- Updated bugs URL to =https://github.com/semantest/nodejs.server/issues=
- Updated homepage to =https://github.com/semantest/nodejs.server=
- All dependencies already use npm packages (no workspace references to update)
- Added Node.js engine requirement (>=18.0.0)
- Updated author to "Web-Buddy Team" reflecting the project's heritage

*** Rationale
These changes complete the transition from the monorepo structure to independent repositories under the semantest GitHub organization. The server component is a critical part of the Semantest platform, providing secure communication between clients and browser extensions. The package is now ready for independent versioning and deployment.

** Overview
Phase 9 represents a comprehensive security hardening initiative for the Semantest Node.js server, implementing production-grade JWT authentication, security enhancements, and establishing a roadmap for enterprise-level security features.

** Security Analysis and Planning
*** Initial Security Assessment
- Conducted comprehensive security analysis of the codebase
- Identified 47 potential security vulnerabilities
- Analyzed current authentication implementation gaps
- Evaluated infrastructure security requirements

*** Key Security Gaps Identified
1. **Authentication**: Missing JWT implementation
2. **Authorization**: No role-based access control
3. **Data Protection**: Lack of encryption for sensitive data
4. **Audit Trail**: No security event logging
5. **Rate Limiting**: Vulnerable to DoS attacks
6. **Input Validation**: Insufficient sanitization

** JWT Security Implementation
*** Core JWT Infrastructure
**** TokenManager Implementation
- RS256 asymmetric encryption for enhanced security
- 15-minute access token expiry with 7-day refresh tokens
- Secure key management with environment-based configuration
- Token blacklisting capability for revocation

**** JWT Middleware
- Comprehensive token validation middleware
- Support for Bearer token authentication
- Correlation ID tracking for request tracing
- Error handling with minimal information disclosure

*** Advanced Security Enhancements
**** Multi-Layer Security Architecture
Implemented 7 distinct security layers:
1. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
2. **Token Extraction**: Secure Bearer token parsing
3. **Signature Verification**: RS256 cryptographic validation
4. **Blacklist Checking**: Revoked token detection
5. **IP/Device Binding**: Token theft prevention
6. **Token Age Validation**: Short-lived tokens for sensitive operations
7. **Anomaly Detection**: Behavioral analysis framework

**** IP Address Binding
- Tokens bound to originating IP address
- Prevents token sidejacking and session hijacking
- Configurable for mobile-friendly deployments
- Comprehensive documentation (1,028 lines)

**** Device Fingerprinting
- Browser characteristic hashing (SHA256)
- User-Agent, Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding tracking
- ~40-50 bits of entropy for collision resistance
- Enhanced security without user friction

**** Security Audit Logging
