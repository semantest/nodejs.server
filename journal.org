* Overview

This repository contains the Node.js server component for Semantest browser automation. It acts as a secure gateway and message router between clients and browser extensions, implementing enterprise-grade features for production deployments.

* Repository History

** Monorepo Separation (2024-01-07)

This repository was extracted from the original chatgpt-buddy monorepo as part of Phase 8A of the Semantest platform evolution. The separation preserves the complete git history of the web-buddy-nodejs-server directory.

*** Key Changes
- Extracted from =web-buddy-nodejs-server/= directory in the monorepo
- Now published as =@semantest/nodejs-server= on npm
- Repository URL: https://github.com/semantest/nodejs.server
- Part of the semantest organization
- Depends on TypeScript-EDA framework

*** Post-Separation Setup Required
1. Update package.json dependencies from workspace references to npm packages
2. Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow
3. Configure npm publishing with NPM_TOKEN secret
4. Update README with proper documentation
