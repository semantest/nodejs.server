ðŸ“Š TEST COVERAGE IMPROVEMENT - FINAL SUMMARY

âœ… OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED:
- Initial coverage: 50.48% (from previous session)
- Final coverage: 55.35% statements
- Total improvement: ~5% increase in test coverage

âœ… WORK COMPLETED:

1. Fixed TypeScript Errors:
   - Fixed server-application.test.ts event constructor signatures
   - Updated test method calls to match actual ServerApplication implementation
   - Added proper mocking for Event, Application, Port, and Adapter classes

2. Created New Test Files:
   - http-server-adapter.test.ts - Comprehensive test suite for HTTP server functionality
   
3. Test Coverage Improvements:
   - Server module: Increased from ~24% to 86% coverage
   - HTTP infrastructure: Improved test coverage with comprehensive route tests
   - Monitoring infrastructure: Maintained high coverage at 71.23%

ðŸ“ˆ COVERAGE BREAKDOWN:
- Statements: 55.35% (2171/3922)
- Branches: 50.15% (473/943)
- Functions: 53.55% (429/801)
- Lines: 55.22% (2102/3806)

ðŸš§ REMAINING WORK:
- Coordination module tests (0% coverage) - BLOCKED awaiting PM approval
- Additional test improvements could target:
  - WebSocket server adapter (4.05% coverage)
  - Start-server.ts (26.19% coverage)
  - Core events modules with lower coverage

ðŸŽ¯ KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
- Exceeded the 50% CI/CD gate requirement
- Established robust testing patterns for future development
- Fixed critical TypeScript compilation errors in tests
- Created reusable mocking patterns for complex dependencies

The test infrastructure is now significantly more robust with comprehensive coverage patterns established for future development.
