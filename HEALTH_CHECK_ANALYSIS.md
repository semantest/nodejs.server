# Health Check Module Analysis

## Overview
The `health-check.ts` module is a comprehensive health monitoring system with 0% coverage. This is a critical production component that needs thorough testing.

## Key Components

### 1. HealthCheckManager Class
- Manages multiple health checks
- Periodic health check execution
- Alert generation and management
- Comprehensive health reporting

### 2. Built-in Health Checks
- **System Health**: CPU/Memory monitoring
- **WebSocket Health**: Connection tracking
- **Process Health**: Heap usage monitoring

### 3. HTTP Endpoints
- `/health` - Comprehensive health report
- `/health/live` - Kubernetes liveness probe
- `/health/ready` - Kubernetes readiness probe
- `/health/service/:name` - Individual service checks
- `/metrics` - Prometheus-compatible metrics
- `/health/alerts` - Active alerts

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests Needed (~40-50 tests)
1. **Health Check Registration** (5 tests)
   - Add/remove health checks
   - Start/stop monitoring
   - Interval management

2. **Health Check Execution** (10 tests)
   - Individual check execution
   - Batch execution
   - Timeout handling
   - Error scenarios

3. **Alert Management** (8 tests)
   - Alert creation
   - Alert filtering
   - Alert retention
   - Severity levels

4. **Status Determination** (5 tests)
   - Overall status calculation
   - Critical service prioritization
   - Degraded state detection

5. **HTTP Endpoints** (15 tests)
   - All 6 endpoints
   - Success/failure scenarios
   - Content negotiation

6. **Default Health Checks** (7 tests)
   - System metrics thresholds
   - WebSocket monitoring
   - Process heap monitoring

## Dependencies to Mock
- Express Router
- Performance metrics
- Logger
- Performance hooks
- Process metrics

## Business Value
- **Critical**: Production monitoring depends on this
- **Risk**: Undetected failures without proper health checks
- **Compliance**: Required for Kubernetes deployments
- **Operations**: Essential for incident response

## Implementation Priority
This should be the #1 priority for Option 2 (Zero Coverage Modules) as it:
- Has 0% coverage
- Is critical for production
- Has clear test boundaries
- Would add significant value immediately
