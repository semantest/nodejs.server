# Testing Strategy to Reach 50% Coverage

## Current State
- **Current Coverage**: ~30-32%
- **Target**: 50%
- **Gap**: ~18-20%

## Fastest Path Analysis

### Option 2 Strategy (Recommended)
**Target: Zero Coverage Modules**

#### Phase 1: Critical Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. **Monitoring Module** (0% → 90%)
   - health-check.ts: 40-50 tests
   - metrics-dashboard.ts: 30-40 tests
   - Impact: +5-6% coverage

2. **Security Module** (0% → 90%)
   - security/index.ts: 20-25 tests
   - Additional middleware: 15-20 tests
   - Impact: +3-4% coverage

#### Phase 2: Core Business Logic (Week 1-2)
3. **Message System** (9% → 80%)
   - Repositories: 25-30 tests
   - Routes: 15-20 tests
   - Impact: +3-4% coverage

4. **Domain Entities** (0% → 95%)
   - Auth entities: 15-20 tests
   - Enterprise entities: 10-15 tests
   - Impact: +2-3% coverage

#### Phase 3: Production Services (Week 2)
5. **Enterprise Services** (0% → 75%)
   - SSO service: 25-30 tests
   - Organization management: 20-25 tests
   - Team management: 20-25 tests
   - Impact: +4-5% coverage

**Total Impact**: +17-22% coverage → **47-54% total coverage**

## Execution Timeline

### Week 1 (Immediate)
- Day 1-2: Health check module (40-50 tests)
- Day 3-4: Security module (35-45 tests)
- Day 5: Message repositories (25-30 tests)

### Week 2 (Following)
- Day 1-2: Domain entities (25-35 tests)
- Day 3-5: Enterprise services (65-80 tests)

## Success Metrics
- **Daily Target**: 30-40 tests/day
- **Coverage Gain**: +1.5-2% per day
- **Time to 50%**: 8-10 working days

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Blocker Risk**: Some modules may have hidden dependencies
   - Mitigation: Have backup modules ready
   
2. **Complexity Risk**: Enterprise services may be complex
   - Mitigation: Start with simpler modules first

3. **Time Risk**: May take longer than estimated
   - Mitigation: Prioritize highest-impact modules

## Recommendations
1. Start with health check module (ready to go)
2. Parallel testing where possible
3. Focus on breadth over depth initially
4. Circle back for edge cases after 50%
