# Queue Test Investigation

## Issue
Queue manager tests are timing out when run

## Started Investigation
- Time: 12:40 PM
- Tests timeout after 2 minutes
- Need to investigate why tests hang

## Findings (12:42 PM)
- Tests are failing on `totalProcessed` and `totalFailed` assertions
- `completeProcessing` and `failProcessing` methods may not be updating counters
- No infrastructure issues (confirmed by DevOps)

## Root Cause Found (12:44 PM)
- `completeProcessing` only emits events: `process:${id}:complete`
- Counter updates happen in `processQueue` method after `waitForProcessing` resolves
- The test expects counters to update immediately after calling `completeProcessing`
- But the item needs to be in "processing" state first!

## Solution
1. Need to trigger processing before calling completeProcessing
2. Or modify test to use the queue's natural flow
3. Or add direct counter updates in completeProcessing (but that breaks separation)

## FIXED (1:05 PM)
- Modified tests to use natural queue processing flow
- Added `stopProcessing()` method to DownloadQueueManager for proper cleanup
- Tests now properly set up event handlers and wait for processing
- All 11 queue manager tests are now passing!
