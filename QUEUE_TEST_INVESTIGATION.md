# Queue Test Investigation

## Issue
Queue manager tests are timing out when run

## Started Investigation
- Time: 12:40 PM
- Tests timeout after 2 minutes
- Need to investigate why tests hang

## Findings (12:42 PM)
- Tests are failing on `totalProcessed` and `totalFailed` assertions
- `completeProcessing` and `failProcessing` methods may not be updating counters
- No infrastructure issues (confirmed by DevOps)

## Next Steps
1. Check implementation of completeProcessing/failProcessing methods
2. Verify status counter updates
3. Look at the DownloadQueueManager implementation
