# NPM Workspace Issue - nodejs.server

## Problem
When running `npm install` in the nodejs.server directory, npm fails with:
```
npm error Invalid Version: 
```

## Root Cause
The nodejs.server directory is inside a workspace setup:
- Parent directory `/home/chous/work/semantest/` has a package.json with workspaces configuration
- npm is detecting the parent workspace and getting confused about versions
- The .npmrc file has `workspaces-update=false` but npm still detects the workspace

## Current State
- **Blocked since**: 3:30 AM (90+ minutes)
- **Impact**: Cannot install test dependencies (supertest, ws)
- **Test failures**: 7/8 test suites failing due to missing dependencies

## Attempted Solutions
1. ❌ Removed package-lock.json
2. ❌ Used --workspaces=false flag
3. ❌ Tried using package-workspace.json instead
4. ❌ Used --legacy-peer-deps flag

## Team Communication
- Reported to Madison (PM) - 3 times
- Reported to Aria (Architect) - 1 time  
- Reported to Eva (Frontend) - 1 time
- No responses yet

## Next Steps
Waiting for architectural guidance on how to properly set up the standalone server within the workspace structure.

## Temporary Workaround
None found yet. The tests cannot run without the missing dependencies.
