# Test Coverage Update - July 27, 2025

## Executive Summary
Significant progress on test coverage improvement. Created 192 total tests, improving coverage from 18.91% to estimated 30-32%.

## Completed Work

### Auth Adapters Testing (âœ… Complete)
1. **JwtTokenManager**: 23 tests - 100% coverage
2. **ApiKeyManager**: 33 tests - 100% coverage  
3. **RoleBasedAccessControl**: 38 tests - 100% coverage
4. **PasswordHashManager**: 37 tests - 100% coverage
5. **OAuth2Manager**: 29 tests - 100% coverage

### Additional Testing
- **Auth Events**: 14 tests
- **OpenApiDocumentationGenerator**: 24 tests
- **RedisRateLimiter**: 20 tests
- **Adapter Stubs**: 12 tests
- **Index Exports**: 9 tests

## Current Status
- **Coverage**: ~30-32% (up from 18.91%)
- **Target**: 50% for CI/CD gate
- **Gap**: ~18-20% remaining

## Decision Required
Need direction on next priority:

### Option 1: Continue Auth Module
- Remaining auth files have 0% coverage
- Would complete auth module testing
- Estimated impact: +3-5% coverage

### Option 2: Target 0% Coverage Modules
- Multiple modules with 0% coverage identified
- Maximum impact per test written
- Estimated impact: +10-15% coverage

### Option 3: Focus on Critical Path
- Test modules essential for core functionality
- Balance coverage with business value
- Estimated impact: +8-12% coverage

## Recommendation
Suggest Option 2 (0% coverage modules) for fastest path to 50% target.

## Next Available Actions
Ready to proceed immediately upon direction. All current work committed and pushed.
