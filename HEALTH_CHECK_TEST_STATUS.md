# Health Check Test Status

## Issue Found
The health check test was written for a different class structure. Current issues:

1. ✅ Fixed: Import was using `HealthCheckService` instead of `HealthCheckManager`
2. ❌ Remaining: Test expects `metadata` property that doesn't exist
3. ❌ Remaining: Test structure doesn't match actual HealthCheckManager implementation

## HealthCheckManager Structure
- Has `healthChecks`, `lastResults`, `checkIntervals`, `alerts` properties
- Constructor takes optional `version` parameter
- Methods include `addHealthCheck()`, `startPeriodicCheck()`, etc.

## Next Steps
The test needs significant rewriting to match the actual HealthCheckManager implementation. This would require:
- Understanding the actual HealthCheckManager API
- Rewriting test cases to test actual functionality
- Ensuring proper mocking of dependencies

## Time Investment
Given the scope of changes needed and that I'm waiting for PM direction on primary work, this might be too large to tackle without explicit approval.

## Current Status
- Fixed import issue
- Identified structural mismatch
- Documented findings for future work
