# Blocker Escalation - 11:30 AM

## Blocker Details
- **Type**: Awaiting PM decision
- **Duration**: 1.5 hours (since 10:00 AM)
- **Impact**: Cannot proceed with test coverage improvement

## Work Completed While Blocked
1. ✅ Zero coverage module analysis
2. ✅ Critical path module analysis  
3. ✅ Health check module deep dive
4. ✅ Testing strategy to reach 50%
5. ✅ All documentation committed

## Decision Required
Which testing approach to take:
- **Option 1**: Complete auth module (+3-5%)
- **Option 2**: Zero coverage modules (+17-25%) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- **Option 3**: Critical path focus (+8-12%)

## Recommendation
**Option 2** provides fastest path to 50% coverage:
- Start with health check module (40-50 tests ready)
- Can achieve 50% in 8-10 days
- All preparation complete

## Next Steps
Ready to begin immediately upon direction:
1. Create health check tests (Day 1)
2. Create security module tests (Day 2)
3. Continue per testing strategy

**Escalation**: If no response by 12:00 PM, should I proceed with recommended Option 2?
