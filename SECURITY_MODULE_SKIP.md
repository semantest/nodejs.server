# Security Module Test Skip Notice

## Issue Encountered
The security module has complex dependencies that require TypeScript EDA packages not available in the test environment:
- `typescript-eda-application`
- `typescript-eda-infrastructure`

## Decision
Skip the main security index.ts file and focus on other zero-coverage modules to maintain momentum.

## Alternative Target
Moving to message repositories which have simpler dependencies and will provide good coverage gains.
