# CRITICAL: GitHub Workflow Fix Required - 9:10 PM

## Issue Reported by rydnr
All GitHub workflows failing with: "No jobs were run"

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. enterprise-security.yml
**Problem**: Job conditions checking for empty string instead of null
```yaml
if: ${{ github.event.inputs.scan_type == 'full' || ... || github.event.inputs.scan_type == '' }}
```

For push/PR events:
- `github.event.inputs` is null/undefined
- Condition `github.event.inputs.scan_type == ''` evaluates to false
- ALL jobs skip â†’ "No jobs were run"

### 2. observability-stack.yml  
**Problem**: Missing push/PR triggers entirely
- Only has `workflow_call` and `workflow_dispatch`
- Never runs on push or pull_request events

## Solution

### Fix for enterprise-security.yml
Replace all job conditions:
```yaml
# OLD (broken)
if: ${{ github.event.inputs.scan_type == 'full' || ... || github.event.inputs.scan_type == '' }}

# NEW (fixed)
if: ${{ !github.event.inputs || github.event.inputs.scan_type == 'full' || ... }}
```

This checks:
1. `!github.event.inputs` - true for push/PR events
2. OR specific scan_type values for manual triggers

### Fix for observability-stack.yml
Add push/PR triggers if needed, or keep as callable-only workflow.
