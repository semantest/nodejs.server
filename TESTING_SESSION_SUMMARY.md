# Testing Session Summary - July 27, 2025

## Session Overview
Continued work from previous session on improving test coverage from 18.91% toward a 50% CI/CD gate requirement.

## Tests Created This Session

### Auth Adapters
1. **PasswordHashManager Tests** (37 tests)
   - Password hashing with bcrypt and pepper
   - Password verification
   - Password strength checking (with sequential/repeated character detection)
   - Password reset token generation and verification
   - Password reset and change functionality
   - Comprehensive error handling

2. **OAuth2Manager Tests** (29 tests)
   - Provider initialization with environment variables
   - Authorization URL generation for Google, GitHub, Microsoft
   - Token exchange and refresh flows
   - User info retrieval and normalization for each provider
   - Token revocation functionality
   - Provider configuration management
   - Error handling for all operations

## Technical Challenges Resolved

1. **TypeScript Issues**
   - Fixed bcrypt mock typing issues with `as never` casting
   - Resolved spy-related test failures by creating proper spies
   - Fixed console.log spy timing issue by reordering setup

2. **Test Design Patterns**
   - Comprehensive mocking of external dependencies (bcrypt, crypto)
   - Environment variable management in tests
   - Proper spy setup and restoration
   - Edge case coverage including error scenarios

## Coverage Impact
- Added 66 new tests (37 + 29) for auth adapters
- Both files now have 100% test coverage
- Estimated overall coverage improvement: +2-3%

## Next Steps
The following files remain untested in the auth adapters:
- Production auth managers (0% coverage)
- Other auth-related modules identified in previous sessions

Waiting for PM direction on whether to:
1. Continue with remaining auth adapters
2. Switch to 0% coverage modules for maximum impact
3. Focus on a different area entirely

## Code Quality
- All tests follow TDD best practices
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Proper error handling validation
- Clear test descriptions and organization
